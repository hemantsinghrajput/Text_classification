The task is to build a text classification model using the Hugging Face library to classify a dataset of text into one of multiple categories.
The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes from the original corpus. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 and testing 7,600.
Uses the Hugging Face library to fine-tune a pre-trained model such as BERT or GPT-2 on the classification task. Uses the transformers library in python.
